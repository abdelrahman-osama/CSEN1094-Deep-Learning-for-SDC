## Task 3: Introduction to Neural Networks
### Task Description:
In this task you will be required to implement **AND**, **OR**, **NOR** and **XOR** operators as perceptrons, use the starter code provided in this repo.
Hint: for the AND, OR and NOT all you need is to play around with the weights and bias to achieve the goal of the perceptron.
For the XOR, you will need to make a combination of the previous operators to do it.
